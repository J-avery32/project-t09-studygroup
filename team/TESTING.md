1. We are using JEST to test the function "getMostCurrentQuarter()" that return the curriculum of the current quarter. 
In the unit test, We need to make sure that this function returns the correct quarter.
We first mock the API, and call getMostCurrentQuarter() to see if it fetches the correct quarter. 

2. In the next few weeks, we will implement unit tests for the basic part in our project if necessary since there are not much time left for us to implement a bunch of unit tests. Implement a few unit tests sometimes will not be as useful as a bunch of unit tests. 

3. We used supertest and Jest to test the actual endpoint of the server. 

4. We probably need to implement an intergation test since it's way more useful than implement only a few unit tests.
