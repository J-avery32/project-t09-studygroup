Project: Study group

Mentor: Nagarjun

Meeting Time: lab01

Type of meeting: daily scrum

Team: Joshua Avery [x], Kenneth Wang [x], Jamie Wang [x], Jennice Xu [x], Anisha Kabir [x], Scribed Discussion:

All the group except for Jennice, who promised to do this later (she finished it), created their own branch and merged a PR into the main branch. We had to work out 
a snag in the github process but eventuallly we figured it out. We also discussed the norms that we wished to put in our norms.md file. Joshua promised to compile these norms 
into the file and submit it to github.
