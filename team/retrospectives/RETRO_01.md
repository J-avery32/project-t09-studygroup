  - feauture branches from main, add code to branch, once done testing merge main branch back into the feauture branch, then make pull request for feauture branch into main

## Retro Assessment

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

* We used the start/stop/continue method for our team retro. We each came up with ideas for each category and took time to discuss each point that was brought up.

A brief assessment of how it went.

* We were able to generate a lot of ideas that help us both with our team communication and our project workflow. Each team member participated and presented their ideas. 

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?

* I would advise the next person leading a retro to make sure to get feedback from the group as the retro is happening, making sure that everyone is on the smae page and knows what is being discussed.
