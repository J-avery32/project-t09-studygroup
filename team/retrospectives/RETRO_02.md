## Retro Assessment

A brief description of what retro outline or process you used.

* We used the start/stop/continue method for our team retro. We each came up with ideas for each category and took time to discuss each point that was brought up.

A brief assessment of how it went.

* We were able to generate a lot of ideas that help us both with our team communication and our project workflow. Each team member participated and presented their ideas. 

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?

* I would advise the next person leading a retro to make sure to get feedback from the group as the retro is happening, making sure that everyone is on the smae page and knows what is being discussed.
  
## Outcome of Retro Experiment
Our measurement was to monitor the amount of pull requests we are able to complete and reflect on our progess. We were able to complete two pull requests so far this past week that moved us closer to our goals. Additionally, through commincation on slack and reflection in person we were able to better monitor our progress.
