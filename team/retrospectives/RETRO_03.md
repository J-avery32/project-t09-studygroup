* We used the quick retro method for our team retro. We each came up with ideas for each category and took time to discuss each point that was brought up.

A brief assessment of how it went.

* We all collaborate and help each others to make sure that we finish the user stories by the deadline.  Each team member participated and presented their ideas. 

What advice would you give to the next person leading a retro based on what you learned today?

* I would advise the next person leading a retro to make sure to record and summary teammates' idea as the retro is happening, making sure that everyone's idea is recorded and all the teammates are on the same page.
